# Go Types

A pointer holds the memory address of a value

The zero value of a pointer is **nil**

```go
func main(){
    i, j := 43, 2090

    <!-- initialize a pointer p to point to i -->
    p := &i

    <!-- set i through pointer p -->
    *p = 40

    <!-- point to j -->
    p = &j
}
```

The **&** operator generates a pointer to its operand while The * operator denotes the pointer's underlying value.

## Structs

This is a collection of fields

<!-- example -->

```go
type Vehicle struct{
    name string
    model string
    plate int
}
```

## Array

Array has a fixed size

var marks [10]int
var names [3]string{"mike", "joan", "brian"}

There is always no space between the square braces and the type.


## Slices

They have dynamic sizes as opposed to arrays. Slices are much common than arrays.

marks := []int{2,3,4,5,6}

slices are mainly formed by specifiying the upper and the lower bound: a[low : high]
<!-- example -->
average[]int := marks[1: 3]

<!-- declaring a slice using make keyword -->
students := make([]string, 8)

<!-- slice of int -->
marks := make([]int, 20);

slices do not store data, they just describe a section of an array. And changine the items in the slice changes them in the underlying array.

## Range

The **range** form of the for loop iterates over a slice or map
<!-- example -->

```go
var pow = []int{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128}
// use range to loop
for i ,v := range pow{
    fmt.Println("2**%d = %d\n", i, v)
}
```

## Map

A map maps keys to values

The zero value of a map is nil. Nil map has no keys, nor can keys be added

<!-- example -->

```go
type Vertex struct{
    Long, Lat float64
}

var m = map[string]Vertex{
    "Bell Labs": {40.68433, -74.39967},
	"Google":    {37.42202, -122.08408},

    // declaring a map using make
    var m = make(map[string]Vertex)
}
```
